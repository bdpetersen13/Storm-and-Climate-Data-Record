# Purpose

The purpose of this final project is to create a Storm and Crime Data Report, shortened to SCDR, for the Miami Police department using historical data provided by the city starting from January 1, 2017, through December 1, 2019. The idea behind gthis project is that it will allow the police department will utilize the report to anticipate, if possible, timeframes for when there will be an increase in criminal activity and combat it as needed. In addition to the analysis, a job aid will be created that will be utilized by new hires that outline the steps before analysis for the SCDR so that they can use it as a model for their future work and projects. 



## Documentation

This repository contains the final implementation plan documentation, the cleaned data for crimes recorded during storm activity and non-storm events, the R-script used for the report, and an in-depth report from October of crimes.
